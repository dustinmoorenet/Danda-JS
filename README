Danda Javascript Library

If you find this useful then great.

Just put the js file where you normally put Javascript files and put the css file where you put style sheets.

JQuery 1.6 and JQuery Template Plugin is required.

This is my first public library, so go easy on me, but any (constructive) recommendations would be helpful.

-- Features --
--------------
Only one for now, I expect more to follow?

-ImageGallery
This transforms a div containing anchor wrapped image tags into an browsable image gallery. Clicking on an image in the gallery causes the image pop out to a larger size.  If you don't override the style for .danda-ui-image-gallery-previous-control and .danda-ui-image-gallery-next-control you will get ugly red controls on each side.

- Example -
<script>
  $(function() {
    danda.ui.ImageGallery('img_gallery');
  });
</script>
<div id="img_gallery">
  <a href="images/1_full.jpg"><img src="images/1_thumb.jpg"/></a>
  <a href="images/2_full.jpg"><img src="images/2_thumb.jpg"/></a>
  <a href="images/3_full.jpg"><img src="images/3_thumb.jpg"/></a>
  ...
</div>
